this is the original code base from 2009 for try ruby.
it is not sandboxed. do not run it on a publicly facing server yet.

it will run the system method. It will let you hose your server.
I am working to make this a saner program.
it does not include the sandbox. you have to use that seperately.

once i have this stable and running I will begin to sandbox this inside of jruby.

from there I will see about the viability of making this use the r bridge so you 
can have ruby to R lessons. :-)
