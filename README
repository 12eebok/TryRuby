This is the FRONT END try ruby files from 2008 piecemeal'd together.

Again, this is only the front end.

I seem to be having issues with anything outside of firefox.
I have not started implementing /irb?cmd= yet.
UPDATE: I am in contact with the whymirror and company to get the sandbox integrated.

I have a few ideas for how to do this.
I figured this would be a great time to explain as far as I can tell how this works, and how you could can
hook this into other languages. 

For instance, you could have a try python. 
Only, you'd probably have to rewrite this in tables, because guido doesn't seem to see the value in css. :-)

-----------------
The Magic behind "try ruby"

index.html
loads several js files...specifically mouseIrb and mouseApp
loads css
loads html

Most of the css and html we can ignore. The real power is in what mouseirb.js and mouseapp are doing.
In this version moo and prototype are making all the ajax go around.

In later versions of this program, _why replaced moo and prototype with jquery and mouseirb simply became irb.js

I will upload those differences once it is clear that I have a full server + client stack working.

I am still working out why there is authentication built in to mouse irb objects.


If this file seems incoherent, it is because I am recovering what I can, and mapping it out at the same time.

In this inital release, I am stabilizing it on a copy of MAMP.
After the first repo checkout it  will be pushed into a rails app (he probably used camping, but he also
didn't leave any of that code... so rails it is)
