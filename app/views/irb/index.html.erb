Welcome to irb. I don't do anything useful yet, but I am about to.
At this point, I have all your front end stuff good to go. 
Yes the idiot putting me back together did so via a rails application-- rather than using camping.

However, now that I have rails on me I can do more stuff in the future :-)

I will soon be able to accept post statements.

Also, I patently refuse to use the sandbox in its running state.
The idea of patching a ruby vm is creepy.
I would sooner be chrooted and/or be shipped off to a vm of my own.

Maybe I should be JRubified. If I go that far, then I can incorporate the R to Ruby bridge
