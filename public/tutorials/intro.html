    <h3>Using the Prompt</h3>
    <p>The blue window above is a Ruby prompt.  Type a line of Ruby code, hit <em>Enter</em>
    and watch it run!</p>
    <p>For example, try typing some math.  Like: <code class="cmd">2 + 6</code></p>
    <div class="answer">\d+</div>
</div>
<div class="stretcher">
    <h3>Numbers &amp; Math</h3>
    <p>Good!  You did a bit of math.  See how the answer popped out?</p>
    <p>Ruby recognizes numbers and mathematic symbols.  You could try some other math like:</p>
    <ul><li><code>4 * 10</code></li>
        <li><code>5 - 12</code></li>
        <li><code>40 / 4</code></li></ul>
    <p>Sure, computers are handy and fast for math.  Let's move on.  Want to see your name reversed?
       Type your first name in quotes like this: <code class="cmd">"Jimmy"</code></p>
    <div class="answer">"(\w+)"</div>
</div>
<div class="stretcher">
    <h3>Say Your Name Backwards</h3>
    <p>Perfect, you've formed a <strong>string</strong> from the letters of your name.  A string
    is a set of characters the computer can process.</p>
    <p>Imagine the letters are on a string of
    laundry line and the quotes are clothespins holding the ends.  The quotes mark the beginning and end.</p>
    <p>To reverse your name, type: <code class="cmd">"Jimmy".reverse</code> (<em>Don't forget the dot!</em>)</p>
    <div class="answer">"(\w+)"</div>
</div>
<div class="stretcher">
    <h3>Counting the Letters</h3>
    <p>You have used the <code>reverse</code> <strong>method</strong> on your name!  By enclosing your name in
    quotes, you made a string.  Then you called the <code>reverse</code> method, which works on strings to flip
    all the letters backwards.</p>
    <p>Now, let's see how many letters are in your name: <code class="cmd">"Jimmy".length</code></p>
    <div class="answer">\d+</div>
</div>
<div class="stretcher">
    <h3>On Repeat</h3>
    <p>Now, I'm sure by now you're wondering what any of this is good for.  Well, I'm sure you've been to
       a website that screamed, <em>Hey, your password is too short!</em>  See, some programs
       use this simple code.</p>
    <p>Watch this.  Let's multiply your name by 5. <code class="cmd">"Jimmy" * 5</code></p>
    <div class="answer">"(\w+)"</div>
</div>
<div class="stretcher chapmark">
    <h3>Hey, Summary #1 Already</h3>
    <p>Let's look at what you've learned in the first minute.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>The prompt.</strong> Typing code into the green prompt gives you
            an answer from a red prompt.  All code gives an answer.</li>
        <li><strong>Numbers and strings</strong> are Ruby's math and text objects.</li>
        <li><strong>Methods.</strong> You've used English-language methods like <code>reverse</code>
            and symbolic methods like <code>*</code> (the multiplication method.)  Methods are action!</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This is the essence of your learning.  Taking simple things, toying with
    them and turning them into new things. Feeling comfortable yet?  I promise you are.</p>
    <p>Okay, let's do something uncomfortable.  Try reversing a number: <code>40.reverse</code></p>
    <div class="stdout">NoMethodError: undefined method `reverse' for (\d+):Fixnum</div>
</div>
<div class="stretcher">
    <h3>Stop, You're Barking Mad!</h3>
    <p>You can't reverse the number forty.  I guess you can hold your monitor up to the
    mirror, but reversing a number just doesn't make sense.  Ruby has tossed an error
    message.  Ruby is telling you there is no method <code>reverse</code> for numbers.</p>
    <p>Maybe if you turn it into a string: <code class="cmd">40.to_s.reverse</code>.</p>
    <div class="answer">\"(\d+)\"</div>
</div>
<div class="stretcher">
    <h3>Boys are Different From Girls</h3>
    <p>And numbers are different from strings.  While you can use methods on any object
    in Ruby, some methods only work on certain types of things.  But you can always
    convert between different types using Ruby's "to" methods.</p>
    <ul><li><strong>to_s</strong> converts things to <strong>s</strong>trings.</li>
        <li><strong>to_i</strong> converts things to <strong>i</strong>ntegers (numbers.)</li>
        <li><strong>to_a</strong> converts things to <strong>a</strong>rrays.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><em>What are arrays?!</em>  They are lists.  Type in a pair of brackets: <code class="cmd">[]</code>.</p>
    <div class="answer">\[\]</div>
</div>
<div class="stretcher">
    <h3>Standing in Line</h3>
    <p>Great, that's an empty list.  Lists store things <strong>in order</strong>.  
       Like standing in line for popcorn.  You are behind someone and you wouldn't
       dream of pushing them aside, right?  And the guy behind you, you've got a 
       close eye on him, right?</p>
    <p>Here's a list for you.  Lottery numbers: <code class="cmd">[12, 47, 35]</code>.</p>
    <div class="answer">\[(\d+(, )?){2,}\]</div>
</div>
<div class="stretcher">
    <h3>One Raises Its Hand</h3>
    <p>A list of lottery numbers.  Which one is the highest?</p>
    <p>Try: <code class="cmd">[12, 47, 35].max</code>.</p>
    <div class="answer">(\d+)</div>
</div>
<div class="stretcher">
    <h3>Tucking a List Away</h3>
    <p>Good, good.  But it's annoying to have to retype that list, isn't it?</p>
    <p>Let's save our numbers inside a <code>ticket</code> like so: <code class="cmd">ticket = [12, 47, 35]</code></p>
    <div class="answer">\[(\d+(, )?){2,}\]</div>
</div>
<div class="stretcher">
    <h3>Now Type Ticket</h3>
    <p>Now, type: <code class="cmd">ticket</code></p>
    <div class="answer">\[(\d+(, )?){2,}\]</div>
</div>
<div class="stretcher">
    <h3>Saved, Tucked Away</h3>
    <p>Fantastic!  You've hung on to your lotto numbers, tucking them away inside a
    <strong>variable</strong> called <code>ticket</code>.</p>
    <p>Let's put your lotto numbers in order, how about?  Use: <code class="cmd">ticket.sort!</code></p>
    <div class="answer">\[(\d+(, )?){2,}\]</div>
</div>
<div class="stretcher chapmark">
    <h3>Summary #2 is Upon Us</h3>
    <p>You had a list.  You sorted the list.  The <code>ticket</code> variable is now changed.</p>
    <p>Did you notice that the <code>sort!</code> method has a big, bright exclamation at the end?
       A lot of times Ruby methods shout like that if they alter the variable for good.  It's nothin
       special, just a mark.</p>
    <p>Now, look how your second minute went:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Errors.</strong> If you try to reverse a number or do anything fishy,
            Ruby will skip the prompt and tell you so.</li>
        <li><strong>Arrays</strong> are lists for storing things in order.</li>
        <li><strong>Variables</strong> save a thing and give it a name.  You used the
        equals sign to do this.<br>Like: <code>ticket = [14, 37, 18]</code>.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>In all there are eight lessons.  You are two-eighths of the way there!  
       This is simple stuff, don't you think?  Good stuff up ahead.</p>
    <p>Let's change directions for a moment.  I've stuffed a bit of poetry for you in
       a certain variable.  Take a look.  Type <code class="cmd">print poem</code></p>
    <div class="load">poem = "My toast has flown from my hand\nAnd my toast has gone to the
moon.\nBut when I saw it on television,\nPlanting our flag on Halley's
comet,\nMore still did I want to eat it.\n"</div>
    <div class="stdout">My toast (.+)</div>
</div>
<div class="stretcher">
    <h3>Sadly, You Hate Toast Poetry</h3>
    <p>Look, it's okay.  You don't have to like it.  Hack it up, be my guest.</p>
    <p>Instead of toast, go for a melon or something.  Try this: <code class="cmd">poem['toast'] = 'honeydew'</code></p>
    <p>And then type <code class="cmd">print poem</code> by itself to see the new poem.</p>
    <div class="stdout">My honey(.+)</div>
</div>
<div class="stretcher">
    <h3>Ready, Aim</h3>
    <p>The square brackets you just used are very common in Ruby.  Remember, you typed: <code>poem['toast'] = 'honeydew'</code>.  That box with the word <em>toast</em> has a square bracket on each side, see?</p>
    <p>The
two brackets are like sights used to line up a target. Exactly. These
brackets mean, "I am looking for ____." Ready, aim. Here you're looking
for toast and swapping it out with fruit.</p>
    <p>Here's a question: what happens when we reverse this whole poem?  <code class="cmd">poem.reverse</code>
    </p><div class="answer">"\\n.ti tae ot (.+)"</div>
</div>
<div class="stretcher">
    <h3>Too Much Reversal</h3>
    <p>Okay, sure.  So the whole poem's been turned backwards, letter-by-letter.  I really want to just
       reverse the lines, though.  Move the last line up to first and the first line down to last.  Backwards, but not
       <em>that</em> backwards.</p> 
    <p>Here's how: <code class="cmd">poem.lines.to_a.reverse</code></p>
    <div class="answer">\["More still did I(.+)"\]</div>
</div>
<div class="stretcher">
    <h3>Ringlets of Chained Methods</h3>
    <p>So what do you see?  What happened there?  You typed <code>poem.lines.to_a.reverse</code> and what happened?</p>
    <p>Two things happened.  You turned the <code>poem</code> into a
list using <code>lines.to_a</code>. <code>lines</code> decides the way
the string is split up, then <code>to_a</code> converted it into an
Array. (<strong>To a</strong>rray.) Different methods, such
as <code>bytes</code> and <code>chars</code> can be used in place
of <code>lines</code>. By using lines, ruby will return each line of the poem.</p>
    <p>Then, you <code>reverse</code>d that list.  You had each line.  You reversed them.  That's it.</p>
    <p>Let's tack one more method on the end there: <code class="cmd">print poem.lines.to_a.reverse.join</code>
    </p><div class="stdout">More still did I(.+)</div>
</div>
<div class="stretcher chapmark">
    <h3>Of All the Summaries, #3 is Here Now</h3>
    <p>Good show, my friend!  The <code>join</code> method took that list of reversed lines and put them
        together into a string.  (Sure, you could have also just used <code>to_s</code>.)</p>
    <p>Review time.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Exclamations.</strong> Methods may have exclamations (and also question marks)
            in their name.  No big deal.  Try: <code>poem.include? "my hand"</code></li>
        <li><strong>Square brackets.</strong>  Target and find things.  Search and replace.</li>
        <li><strong>Chaining</strong> methods lets you get a lot more done.  Break up a poem,
            reverse it, reassemble it: <code>poem.lines.to_a.reverse.join</code></li>
    </ul>
    <p>At this point, you may want to tinker with the poem a bit more.  A complete list of all
    the <code>String</code> methods is <a href="http://www.whytheluckystiff.net/ruby/pickaxe/html/ref_c_string.html" target="_new">here</a>.  Go ahead and try a few (such as <code>poem.downcase</code> or <code>poem.delete</code>.)</p>
    <p>When you're ready to move on, type: <code class="cmd">books = {}</code></p>
    <div class="answer">\{\}</div>
