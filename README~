This is the ENTIRE ORIGINAL CODE BASE RECOVERED.

The sandbox is still needed to make this work 100%, right now it is only 80% complete in terms of tutorial lessons!
nanothief, again thanks.

What is missing is all the â€Žfile system lesson stuff.
nanothief added a next function so you can skip lessons.

UPDATE: I am in contact with the whymirror and company to get the sandbox integrated.

Once I can get this fully running and sandboxed and chrooted, I will host a copy.
This code is not sandboxed right now, it will run system commands, it will allow
you to rm -FR /

Do not run this code publicly facing yet!

Also, to my surprise, this depends on ruby,php, and cgi on the back end
and html,css,js on the front end.

I have plans on moving this entire thing into ruby and dropping the cgi and php dependencies.
